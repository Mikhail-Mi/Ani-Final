# Paddle Battle UI

This project is a recreation of the "Paddle Battle" game UI based on an image provided.

## Files

- `index.html`: The main HTML structure of the UI.
- `style.css`: Contains all the CSS rules for styling the UI, including neon effects and layout.
- `script.js`: Placeholder for JavaScript interactivity (e.g., button clicks, sound toggles).

## Setup

1.  Ensure all three files (`index.html`, `style.css`, `script.js`) are in the same directory.
2.  Open `index.html` in a web browser to view the UI.

## Features Replicated

- Neon pink and cyan color scheme.
- Retro pixel font (using Google Fonts 'Press Start 2P').
- "PADDLE BATTLE 1.1" title.
- "PLAY" and "HOW TO PLAY" buttons with distinct neon borders and corner accents.
- Placeholder icons for mute and music toggle.
- Animated neon border around the main container.
- Text flicker animation for the main title.

## To-Do / Potential Enhancements

- Replace placeholder icons with more accurate SVGs or font icons.
- Implement actual game logic for the "PLAY" button.
- Create a "HOW TO PLAY" screen/modal.
- Add sound effects and background music with functional controls.
- Refine animations and visual effects for closer resemblance to the original image if needed.
